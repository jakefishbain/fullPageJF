export const summary = `Dedicated developer, teacher, and candy-lover, I am a motivated 'edu-coder' striving to help others through knowledge and compassion. I approach a challenge with an open mind, breaking down the issue into its individual parts and tackling each one systematically.

I pride myself in being able to connect the dots, implement a plan, and share my learnings.

Having taught special education across various settings, I believe communication holds together the framework of any successful partnership. The same is true in programming, regardless of the language.

I am a capable developer with a creative touch. Merging my love for learning, teaching and technology, the possibilities are endless!`
